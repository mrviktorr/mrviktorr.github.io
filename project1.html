    </header>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>Trains have been a popular form of transportation since the 19th century. When the first steam train was built in 1804, 
            people were worried that the speed would make rail passengers to breathe or that they would be shaken unconscious by the 
            vibrations. But by the 1850s, passengers were traveling at previously unthinkable speeds of 80km/hr or more. Rail travel was 
            cheap, and people who had never been on a journey before could now afford to make trips by train. Cities that had once seemed 
            far apart suddenly felt much closer together, because people and goods could move between them in hours rather than days. In 
            some places, new towns sprang up beside the tracks.</p>

            <p>Railways existed long before steam engines were invented. From the mid-1500s onwards, railways were used in some European mines 
                to move heavy wagonloads of coal and mineral ore along tunnels. Later, others were built to carry coal from coal mines to ships 
                in nearby rivers and harbours. THe wagons ran first on parallel wooden planks, and then on iron rails. The job of hauling the 
                wagons was done by people or horses. Some wagons, such as the one on the right, could freewheel downhill, controlled by a driver
                operating the brake. A horse pulled the empty wagon back up the hill for the next load.</p>

        <h3>Steam locomotives</h3>
        <div class="container2">
            <img src="steam_locomotive.jpg" width="300" alt="steam locomotive">
            <p>Steam-powered locomotives were invented in the early 1800s. At first they pulled wagons full of coal, and later carriages 
                full of people. A steam locomotive generally burnt coal in a furnace, or "firebox", and the fire heated water in a boiler 
                to make steam. The steam was fed into cylinders to drive moveable rods called pistons, and the motion of the pistons was 
                used to turn the wheels. One of the most successful early steam locomotives was <em>Rocket</em>, built by English engineer
                Robert Stephenson. In 1829, Rocket won a contest called the Rainhill Trials to find the best locomotive. The winner got the
                contract to pull trains on the world's first inter-city line, between Liverpool and Manchester in the UK.</p><br>
        
            <p>In US most locomotives had wood-burning engines. Wood did not produce such a fierce heat as coal, but in North America it 
                was plentiful and cheaper than coal. A shower of sparks often came out of the chimney along wth the smoke and steam, and 
                the sparks could set fire to forests and dry grassland, and even trackside buildings. Devices called "spark arrestors" 
                were fitted to the chimneys to try to stop this from happening. American locomotives usually had a small, pivoting truck 
                called a bogey at the front to help the engine go round sharp curves. A cowcatcher at the front was needed to push 
                obstacles off the track, on the open grasslands of North America.</p>

        <h3>Electric trains</h3>
        <div class="container3">
            <img src="electric.jpg" width="300" alt="electric train">
            <p>Engineers developed the first electric locomotives in the late 19th century. By the 1930s, they had become very popular. 
                From the 1940s to the 1960s, electric and diesel trains replaced steam power in many countries. An electric locomotive 
                uses electric motors to drive the wheels. Some locomotives collect electricity from overhead cables, while others take 
                power from a third "live" rail on the track. It is very expensive to build the lines or rails that carry the electric 
                current. But electric locomotives are cleaner, quieter, faster, and more reliable than steam or diesel engines. Today, 
                most high-speed trains are powered by electricity, and also busy city lines like underground railways and commuter 
                services.</p>

        <h3>High-speed Trains</h3>
        <div class="container4">
            <img src="ice.jpg" width="300" alt="high-speed train">
            <p>High speed train is a type of rail transport that runs significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an 
                integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies 
                worldwide, new lines in excess of 250 kilometres per hour and existing lines in excess of 200 kilometres per hour are 
                widely considered to be high-speed.The first high-speed trains appeared in Japan in 1964. Today, there are high-speed 
                trains in many countries, including the TGV in France.</p>
